	First you need to create a discord bot https://discord.com/developers/applications
New application, Name, Agree the terms
Then on the left, click on bot, reset token and copy it. Now open the file BOT in python, and put your token.
Now go back on your bot and select all the intent.
Go on OAuth2 and scroll down till you get the link. Copy, paste it on your broswer and select your server

	Then search your ahkv2 file path and paste it in the BOT python file

	And finally open a terminal (Windows + R), type cmd, now the path of your BOT file and then type : 
python BOT.py 		to start the bot
Now simply type !rejoin on your discord server and that's it ig

Don't ever close the terminal since the bot isn't hosted on a server for now but on your pc
if you want to get a screen of your game then create a webhook on your server and paste it in the file ScreenDiscordWebhook, it's not complete yet but still useful sometimes.
Ctrl o to stop it, you can change the timer at the end of the script which is currently 3s
